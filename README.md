Idea 1: Game: Shoot Planes

  utilize: Qt and Visual Studio (C++)
  screen is divided into 3~5 sectors vertically
  Enemy airplanes (or aliens) fall from each sector: random
  enemy airplanes (or aliens) are given energy (random)
  
  player is given energy and set shoot power
  player moves around using direction keys (2D) and press key (ex. q) to shoot
  
  if alien hits the player,player loses energy.
  5 types of aliens. 
  boss alien at the end. If player successfully kills boss alien, player wins.
  If player's energy reaches 0, player loses.
  
  If time permits: different difficulties, different number of sectors, "cheat-version" with stronger weapons
