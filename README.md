Idea 1: Game: Shoot Planes

  utilize: Qt and Visual Studio (C++)
  screen is divided into 3~5 sectors vertically
  Enemy airplanes (or aliens) fall from each sector: random
  enemy airplanes (or aliens) are given energy (random)
  
  player is given energy and set shoot power
  player moves around using direction keys (2D) and press key (ex. q) to shoot
  
  if alien hits the player,player loses energy.
  5 types of aliens. 
  boss alien at the end. If player successfully kills boss alien, player wins.
  If player's energy reaches 0, player loses.
  
  If time permits: different difficulties, different number of sectors, "cheat-version" with stronger weapons

Idea 2: Game: Zombie Attack
  
  utiize Qt and Visual Studio (C++)
  screen is divided into 3~5 sectors horizontally
  similar to Plant vs Zombie
  Zombies come randomly from lanes
  Player has energy (life). 
  Player can shoot: certain distance
  Zombies slow down when they get shot. (They also have life energy)
  Player loses energy when zombies reach the end. 
  Player can "allocate" a shield and a gun at certain blocks by using its "power energy" (not life).
  Power energy increases per time: ex) 100 energy regenerates in 10 seconds.
